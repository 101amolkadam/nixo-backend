# Nixo Backend

- This backend is building with nodejs, express, and mongodb.
- This is our second backend or you can say updated version basically we are moving our backend from strapi to nodejs for more control.
- We also will build our custom dashboard with react and this backend can be used with that along with the main client side Nixo website (https://nixo.vercel.app)
